            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>In the beginning of the whole year, Mr. Mueller assigned us a year long website/project to present to different people. We had to use the things that we were taught. For example, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap towards the website.</p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p>The teacher told us to create a website that we were interested in, to in which this is where I found my partner(Benjamin). We both decided to choose gambling and I asked if I could work with him, then we both agreeed to be partners and work together. We had to pick a tool and we chose <a href=https://materializecss.com/.>Materialize</a>. With that, we used the components of the Parallax, Navbar, and the cards. </p>
            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>We had a bit of trouble with a few things which includes of communication, cards, and the navbar. Our communication skills wasn't the best, since we had a different period to work on the website. The cards were uneven because of the amount of text and different sizes of the picture, however it also wasn't that responsive either. Lastly we had some minor problems with the Navbar and Parallax. We had to change the Navbar because it was also wasn't responsive, for the parallax the image wasn't clear enough for people to see.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>I've realized how important feedback could be since we've realized what could make our website better. I found that the project overall was really fun and interesting because of the "freedom" of using your own tool and your own design of the website. I applied the tool and also realized that I've learned a lot from the beginning of the year to now. My next step is to apply the feedback of the presentation towards the next time I present.</p>
