            <h3> Context </h3>
            <p> Mr. Mueller assigned the whole class to work on a movie webpage of whatever our imagination leads to, then he assigned everyone partners. Me and my partner (Tyler) were going to work on our project using the basic knowledge of basic HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h3> Content </h3>
            <p> Me and my partner decided to make a comedy and horror movie, since it was a week before Halloween my partner picked  the Halloween horror ideas. While I wanted to do something funny and family-friendly, I thought that comedy wouldn't really fit with the movie idea, so then we both decided to focus on the genre of horror. After a few days, I used my prior knowledge and notes to help me with my project. I also needed to help my partner with doing a jumpscare, so I needed a little help with making a gif into the code. I overcame that problem with researching online with [W3schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/). </p>
            <h3> Reflection</h3>
            <p> Overall, I found that throughout this process using communication is very crucial with working together. I found that before it wasn't that important and that you don't have to do much since you communicate in class and finish the rest at home. However, I didn't understand much and I was confused on what my partner was planning and what to do. It was a good idea to plan before hand for a least someway to contact my partner then we had enough time to finish the project by Wednesday.
