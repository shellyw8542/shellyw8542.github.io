            <h1>Context</h1>
          <p>For my freedom project, I wanted to create a shooter game that is different from all of the popular games out there. My partner and I decided to create a calming shooter game; if the player doesn't like to shoot, they can admire the view of the city. We were able to create this game based on our knowledge of CSS, HTML, Javascript, and our tool A-frame. Our main goal of this project is to help the people with destressing.</p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p>The Quiet City is a game when you press the spacebar, you can shoot a ball onto the clouds. The clouds are the targets that when you get all of the clouds within 3 minutes you may be allowed to look at the starry night sky. However, if you are not able to achieve that goal, you can also be able to explore the city and try to find the mascot. Be sure to have fun and enjoy the moment!!</p>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Some challenges that I've faced were connecting HTML with Javascript, communication, and learning the tool A-frame. In the tool A-frame, the Javascript was a bit strange for me since they had their own Javascript components like "space" instead of the keycode so I had to follow a tutorial to help me understand that problem. Connecting the HTML was a bit more difficult for me because I didn't know how to add the physics component in the actual project, it took a few attempts until I got it. Also, communication was a bit of a problem because there would be some times when our partnership would be quite busy since we would have some busy weeks and then we would have to work independently. But we eventually managed to work together and worked it out most conveniently and efficiently. One takeaway I've gotten when doing this project is communication helps accomplish a lot no matter if you're doing it with a partner or without a partner, it helps with the struggles that you've faced. Another takeaway I've gotten from this project is that doing major projects can help me develop new skills and also benefit my understanding with the resources that I've gotten. For example, I've used my tool A-frame to help me with my project. The tool A-frame made me read documents, watch tutorials, and practice with the components that are new to me. I've learned multiple skills like organization, debugging, and applying my knowledge to what I've learned throughout the year. Although I am proud of my project, my next step for the next freedom project is to learn from my mistakes in this freedom project. I believe that I will need to manage my time wisely and patiently take my time with my project to have a more smooth matter of the project.</p>
